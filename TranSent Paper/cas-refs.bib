 abstract = {App-based demand-responsive transit (DRT) services are emerging where conventional public transport is unable to meet the demand. SWVL (choice A) and Airlift (choice B) are two such DRT bus services operating in Lahore, Pakistan. It is important for the policy makers and operators to evaluate the satisfaction levels of the passengers using these services. This study evaluated passengers’ satisfaction regarding choice A and choice B through a questionnaire survey. A total of 440 responses were collected from the users of the DRT services through personal interviews and a web-based approach. Factor analysis on the collected data produced two underlying factors, namely serviceattributes and bus ambiance. Ordinal regression showed that the service-attributes and ambiance were significant predictors of overall satisfaction levels about choice A. Service-attributes indicated a larger positive impact on overall satisfaction with choice A as compared to ambiance. Although the ordinal model for choice B fitted the data well, the predictors were found to be insignificant. The results offer an insight into which predictors affect the overall satisfaction and how it can be},

@article{abenoza2018tra,
 abstract = {Understanding how satisfaction with individual trip legs aggregates to the over- all travel experience for different types of trips will enable the identification of the trip legs that are most impactful. For this purpose we analyze data on retrospective evaluations of entire multi-modal trip experiences and satisfaction with individual trip legs. We formu- late and describe alternative aggregation rules and underpin them in theory and previous empirical findings. The results of a series of regression models show that for a large num- ber of multi-modal trip configurations normative rules can better reproduce overall travel satisfaction than heuristic rules. This indicates that all trip legs need to be considered when evaluating the overall travel experience, especially for trips legs involving waiting and/or transferring time. In particular, weighting satisfaction with individual trip legs with per- ceived trip leg durations yielded the best predictor of overall travel satisfaction. No evi- dence for a disproportional effect of the last or most exceptional part of the trip was found. However, a larger dataset would be needed in order to replicate this work and potentially generalize the results. This research contributes to the literature on combining multi-epi- sodic experiences and provides novel empirical evidence in the transport domain.},

This feedback not only measures patient satisfaction and improves health service quality but also offers crucial insights into the effectiveness of medical treatments, pain management strategies, and alternative therapies. This study systematically identifies and categorizes key aspects of patient experiences, emphasizing both positive and negative sentiments expressed in their narratives. We collected a dataset of approximately 15,000 entries from various sections of the widely used medical forum, patient.info. Our innovative approach integrates content analysis with aspect-based sentiment analysis, deep learning techniques, and a large language model (LLM) to analyze these data. Our methodology is designed to uncover a wide range of aspect types reflected in patient feedback. The analysis revealed seven distinct aspect types prevalent in the feedback, demonstrating that deep learning models can effectively predict these aspect types and their corresponding sentiment values. Notably, the LLM with few-shot learning outperformed other models. Our findings enhance the understanding of patient experiences in online forums and underscore the utility of advanced analytical techniques in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured patient feedback, offering valuable implications for healthcare providers and medical service management.},

 abstract = {Free public transit for older adults is a policy often advocated for to increase ridership and reduce their dependence on automobiles. In July 2023 public transit became free on the island of Montréal for older adults (65+). Drawing from longitudinal repeated survey data collected in February 2023 and September 2023 and in-depth interviews collected in November 2023, we study the impacts of free public transit fare policy on older adults’ (65+) frequency of public transit use and satisfaction with service. We did not observe any change in public transit use among those who anticipated increased use in the before period, nor among those who anticipated no change in their use after the implementation of the free fare policy. We observed a positive change in the perception of the convenience of public transit after the implementation of the free fare policy for older adults.},

 abstract = {Measuring public opinion about the quality of transit services is a key factor in understanding and addressing customer dissatisfaction and increasing customer loyalty and ridership. Sentiment analysis using social media—in particular Twitter—is a relatively cheap and potentially powerful complement to traditional survey methods, which are expensive and limited in sample size. This study aims to evaluate customer response to the introduction of Calgary Transit’s MAX routes. We compared customer satisfaction expressed on Twitter with measured service reliability in the form of on-time performance. We also employed a qualitative research approach using content analysis from Twitter to gauge rider satisfaction over several service attributes before and after the service change. A transit-specific sentiment lexicon was developed to support this study using a hybrid approach. This lexicon outperformed generic sentiment lexicons traditionally used in transit studies with regard to both accuracy (18.4%) and F1-score (7.1%). We found that the overall perception of on-time performance from riders using Twitter was similar to the actual performance in the field. This was also observed for one individual route on which stops with poor schedule adherence were linked with negative feedback. This study concludes that combining customer-oriented measures from Twitter with operational-oriented ones would enable transit agencies to make better-informed decisions for planning and operational purposes.},

 abstract = {What items contribute to user satisfaction with large ubiquitous systems? This article reports on studies that seek answers to this question through the context of London Transport's Oyster system. Two studies are presented. In the first, an existing quantitative instrument (End-User Computing Satisfaction, or EUCS), originally developed to evaluate satisfaction with mandatory use systems, is used to measure satisfaction through a small survey. In the second, Twitter data are used to demonstrate how broader items contribute to user satisfaction. The first study demonstrates that the EUCS constructs of Content, Accuracy, Format, Ease of use, and Timeliness are still statistically valid, although discriminant problems exist. However, the second study, the analysis of Twitter activity, reveals that Content and Format are not relevant to Oyster users, and that Accuracy and Timeliness are conceptualized very differently. Moreover, Ubiquity emerges as an important item contributing to satisfaction, or in some cases dissatisfaction.},

 abstract = {Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most capable online search algorithms for sequential planning tasks, with significant applications in areas such as resource allocation and transit planning. Despite its strong performance in real-world deployment, the inherent complexity of MCTS makes it challenging to understand for users without technical background. This paper considers the use of MCTS in transportation routing services, where the algorithm is integrated to develop optimized route plans. These plans are required to meet a range of constraints and requirements simultaneously, further complicating the task of explaining the algorithm's operation in real-world contexts. To address this critical research gap, we introduce a novel computation tree logic-based explainer for MCTS. Our framework begins by taking user-defined requirements and translating them into rigorous logic specifications through the use of language templates. Then, our explainer incorporates a logic verification and quantitative evaluation module that validates the states and actions traversed by the MCTS algorithm. The outcomes of this analysis are then rendered into human-readable descriptive text using a second set of language templates. The user satisfaction of our approach was assessed through a survey with 82 participants. The results indicated that our explanatory approach significantly outperforms other baselines in user preference.},

The popular tourism destination of the Island of Kos in Greece was used as the case study for this research, while two appropriate statistical methods were employed, Factor Analysis and Ordered Probit models. According to the analysis, the most significant factor for the tourists when deciding to use public transport is service production, reflecting route frequencies and reliability of service. On the contrary, residents place more focus on qualitative aspects such as comfort, safety and information. Furthermore, a common factor that holds a high position in the preferences of both tourists and residents is transfer quality, comprising attributes related to transfer coordination. The paper presents in detail the results derived from the two analyses and discusses the use of these results by local authorities in order to adjust their policy plans accordingly and to define actions that can better tackle the residents and tourists’ needs and expectations.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Universities and other educational institutions across the United States collaborate with service providers to afford their students, faculty, and staff transit services, such as dedicated buses, on-demand ridesharing, and public transportation. The university community relies on these services, especially in rural and low-density areas without fixed-route transit services. The literature on this topic has a wealth of detailed material about the travel and usage patterns of public transit systems, but it has little information about users’ satisfaction with the transit services provided by universities. Method: This study focuses on filling this gap by using descriptive statistics and ordered logistic regression to determine how satisfied users are with university transit services and what factors are associated with their level of satisfaction. Four public transit services available to the University of Texas at Arlington community served as our case studies. Results and Discussion: The results revealed that most users are satisfied with the services overall. Riders were highly satisfied with service attributes like ease of boarding, cleanliness, customer service, and vehicle speed of the four services. On the other hand, they were least satisfied with service availability and wait times of these services. The findings from this study may be used to provide the UTA community with better mobility and accessibility options and to evaluate the levels of satisfaction with similar services offered to other university communities.},

Reward design plays a pivotal role in training game AI models, wherein researchers implement concepts of specific reward functions. However, despite the presence of AI, the reward design process predominantly remains in the domain of human experts, as it is heavily reliant on their creativity and engineering skills. Therefore, this paper proposes ChatPCG, a large language model (LLM)-driven reward design framework. It leverages humanlevel insights, coupled with game expertise, to generate rewards tailored to specific game features automatically. Moreover, ChatPCG is integrated with deep reinforcement learning, demonstrating its potential for multiplayer game content generation tasks. The results suggest that the proposed LLM exhibits the capability to comprehend game mechanics and content generation tasks, enabling tailored content generation for a specified game. This study not only highlights the potential for improving accessibility in content generation but also aims to streamline the game AI development process.},

Air transport companies must gain and retain customers in order to remain competitive. Here we assessed passenger perceptions of air travel service quality using multicriteria satisfaction analysis (MUSA) that may provide deeper insights into consumer behaviour than previous studies. During a three-year period from 2016 to 2018, we assessed perceptions of air travellers using a survey that asked about air travel experiences within Croatia in the year prior to the year of the survey in order to avoid the influence of current feelings. Then we analysed survey responses using MUSA method and found that overall passenger satisfaction depended strongly on service at the departure airport, which many of our respondents judged to be inadequate. We have additionally fine-tuned the improvement priority list by incorporating passenger demand levels. Our results may help guide efforts at air transport companies to improve service quality and to better understand how passengers perceive their services.},

 abstract = {Transit ridership depends on its quality of service. Many studies have analyzed rider satisfaction surveys to explore important service attributes and/or identify improvement priorities. Importance-performance analysis (IPA) is capable of serving both purposes. However, it assumes that service attributes have a symmetric influence on rider satisfaction. To relax the assumption, this study applies three-factor theory to classify service attributes into basic, performance, and excitement factors. Using the 2013 data of bus, bus rapid transit (BRT), and metro transit riders from Guangzhou, China, it compares the results from two alternative IPA and two applications of the three-factor theory. Explicit IPA and implicit IPA classify service attributes somewhat differently but produce similar improvement priorities. For the three-factor theory, the importance grid yields more plausible results than regression with dummy variables. This study further concludes divergent improvement priorities for different services: comfort while waiting at station/stop and service reliability for bus; safety while waiting, safety while riding, and comfort while waiting for BRT; and spatial coverage for metro transit. If resources are abundant, transit agencies could also improve customer service for bus and comfort while riding for BRT.},

 abstract = {Train delays can propagate rapidly throughout the Urban Rail Transit (URT) network under networked operation conditions, posing significant challenges to operational departments. Accurately predicting passenger travel choices under train delays can provide interpretable insights into the redistribution of passenger flow, offering crucial decision support for emergency response and service recovery. However, the diversity of travel choices due to passenger heterogeneity and the sparsity of delay events leads to issues of data sparsity and sample imbalance in the travel choices dataset under metro delays. It is challenging to model this problem using traditional machine learning approaches, which typically rely on large, balanced datasets. Given the strengths of large language models (LLMs) in text processing, understanding, and their capabilities in small-sample and even zero-shot learning, this paper proposes a novel Passenger Travel Choice prediction framework under metro delays with the Large Language Model (DelayPTC-LLM). The well-designed prompting engineering is developed to guide the LLM in making and rationalizing predictions about travel choices, taking into account passenger heterogeneity and features of the delay events. Utilizing real-world data from Shenzhen Metro, including Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data and detailed delay logs, a comparative analysis of DelayPTC-LLM with traditional prediction models demonstrates the superior capability of LLMs in handling complex, sparse datasets commonly encountered under disruption of transportation systems. The results validate the advantages of DelayPTC-LLM in terms of predictive accuracy and its potential to provide actionable insights for big traffic data.},

Performing a scientific and reasonable evaluation of the present bus traffic transfer service is highly significant for improving the efficiency of the HSR and increasing the use of the system. This paper focuses on the passengers’ transfer experience and proposes a methodology to evaluate current bus traffic transfer service. Factors that affect passenger satisfaction during the bus transfer process at HSR stations based on the passengers’ perceptions are analyzed by convenience, comfort, safety, service, and economy. A structural equation model (SEM) is developed as an evaluation approach to explore the correlations of bus transfer service, passenger perceived value, and passenger satisfaction. To calibrate the model, a questionnaire survey of passengers transferring to a bus was conducted at Xi’anbei Railway Station. This paper analyzes the relationships between observed variables and latent variables in the measured model, the influences of exogenous variables on endogenous variables in the structural model, and the impact of the passengers’ socioeconomic attributes on passenger satisfaction. Analysis results of the SEM show that economy and convenience are the critical influential indicators of passenger satisfaction, among which bus fare preferential policy and transfer distance are the most significant factors. The findings can provide helpful information for planners and managers to improve the services of existing HSR stations and to guide the planning of new ones.},

 abstract = {Cross-category recommendation systems aim to suggest items to users from various categories, enhancing the user experience by broadening their exposure to diverse products or services. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for improving the effectiveness of such systems. LLMs, trained on vast datasets, excel at understanding complex relationships between different categories of products by analysing patterns in user interactions, preferences, and item descriptions. By leveraging natural language understanding, these models can identify similarities and connections between disparate product categories, enabling more personalized and relevant cross-category recommendations. 
This approach goes beyond traditional recommendation algorithms that typically focus on a single category or rely heavily on collaborative filtering techniques. Instead, LLMs can process and integrate information from multiple domains, making it easier to suggest complementary products from different categories that users may not have initially considered. Additionally, LLMs can interpret contextual information, such as user reviews and sentiment analysis, to further refine recommendations based on the user's unique preferences and behavioural patterns. 
The potential of LLMs in cross-category recommendations opens new possibilities for e-commerce, entertainment, and other industries where personalized experiences are key to user engagement and satisfaction. As these models continue to evolve, they offer the promise of more intelligent and comprehensive recommendation systems that can better meet the needs of users by offering diverse and relevant suggestions across categories. 
These abstract outlines the key role of LLMs in advancing cross-category recommendation systems, highlighting their capacity to improve personalization and broaden the scope of recommendations.},

 abstract = {The analysis of service quality in public transportation has become very popular in the last few years, when transport planners and managers have begun to focus all their efforts on a continuous improvement of the service quality. Knowing the passengers’ perceptions about different characteristics describing the service allows transport managers to decide where they have to apply their actions. However, passengers’ perceptions and requirements about public transport services are very heterogeneous among users, and also over the time. Segmentation is normally carried out in order to reduce this heterogeneity, and with an annually or six-monthly frequency, detailed analysis are performed in order to identify the most significant changes in passengers’ opinions. In this research work, a segmentation based on the gender of passengers is developed, in order to discover and compare the key factors affecting the perceptions of men and women about the quality of service. Data from three consecutive Customer Satisfaction Surveys (2009–2011) developed in the metropolitan transit service of Granada (Spain) are used, and the evolution of the most influence factors for men and women across the years is shown. For this purpose, a novel methodology for the analysis of service quality is presented. Decision Trees, and particularly the CART algorithm, has been applied. This is a non-parametric technique, with no pre-defined underlying relationship between the target (dependent) variable and the predictors (independent variables), which has several advantages over parametric models. The main results shown that for men the most influence variable changes among Safety, Punctuality and Timetable, while for women, the key factor varies among Speed, Frequency, and Timetable.},

However, what is less explored is that this travel satisfaction is not only an outcome of travel-related preferences and choices, but that travel satisfaction can also be a predictor of travel-related components. In this conceptual paper we tend to fill the gaps in the existing − albeit rather fragmented − literature concerning travel satisfaction. We provide an overview of the elements explaining travel satisfaction, and possible outcomes of travel satisfaction, with a focus on (i) subjective well-being, (ii) travel mode choice, (iii) travel-related attitudes, and (iv) the residential location. Furthermore, we suggest a continuous cyclical process including the four above mentioned elements in which travel satisfaction plays an essential role; a process which can result in the formation of travel habits.},

 abstract = {Modeling the opinion dynamics of transit system riders is key to understanding their needs, motivations and sensitivities for service changes. This can make planning and operations processes to match user profile, hence promoting more transit usage with positive results on sustainable development. This research work investigated the triangulation of social (how users are related to each other) and semantic (what issues/topics are on user minds) network analysis as well as sentiment analysis (how do they feel about these topics) of social media interactions for supporting better understanding of transit user opinions and levels of satisfaction. We used data from the Twitter account of TransLink (Vancouver transit agency); tracked them over 11 month period; compared them to similar data from two other Canadian cities; and, in so doing, contrasted the results in days with disruptions and days with normal operations. Our research work developed a methodology that can be guide agencies in this regards. First, the social network should be qualified as a viable community (small world), not just a random graph (with sparsely connected nodes). It should be clustered into sub-communities based on their connectivity and the issues they discuss. Second, we used a lexicon for customer satisfaction to detect topics in tweets. Linking topics to sentiments (user view of them) can be used as indicator for their opinion. Studying the variations of topics and sentiment across sub-communities, we can observe the origination of ideas. By tracking the evolution of the social network, we could study the potential impacts of social interaction (possibly learning) on opinion dynamics. In the specific case of Vancouver data, sentiment was negative, indicating a lower levels of satisfaction across all topics. However, this negativity should be taken in context — many social media interactions (especially Twitter) have negative sentiment. Interestingly, analysis of sentiment levels in days with disruption, particularly those related to public safety incidents, showed lower levels of negative attitude. This contrast could be an indirect measure of trust: while customers may not be satisfied with services, they trust that the agency is doing its best to protect them. Analysis of customer social networks showed that the sub-network of the most influential players closely matched of the full network in terms of topics and sentiment. Analysis of sub-communities shows that the network is not a venue for disseminating information by the agency. Many sub-groups, especially the ones we call medium-size groups (defined in our work as having between a 1000 and 10,000 nodes), portray a more of inter-customer interactions. It seems this is where discussions and topics evolve. The results of our analysis is specific to Vancouver and to the data and period investigated. They should not be generalized given the evolutionary nature of social media contents and the dynamics of opinion. Our methodology, however, can be used as benchmark or a starting point to conducting similar analysis in other agencies. The interpretation, as always, will remain context-sensitive (influenced by local conditions). Transit agencies should conduct such analysis frequently; experiment with adjusting its steps and the proposed algorithms to their local conditions; and establish a mechanism for the frequency of such analysis. More importantly, they should always triangulate the results of such analysis against findings from other sources of data such as community meetings and customer surveys.},

 abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ASBA) is a refined approach to sentiment analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects or features of a product, service, or entity. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts, ABSA focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects (e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. This allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. The process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph or any other form that the users have provided. ABSA has significant applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. By leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ABSA facilitates the extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. As ABSA evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various product aspects. In this work, we have analyzed the strength of LLMs for a complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations. We argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 12.},

 abstract = {Light rail transit (LRT) is a sustainable transportation mode that ensures sustainable environmental, economic, and social development. Generally, the rate of public transportation usage in many parts of the world remains low compared to private vehicles. There is a need to understand passengers’ perception of public transportation service quality to enhance passenger satisfaction and increase ridership. Thus, this study used the Kuala Lumpur LRT service as a case study to investigate the effect of a passenger’s gender and age on their perception of the LRT service quality and their overall satisfaction. This survey involved 417 respondents. The outcome of factor analysis indicated that eight factors—i.e., signage, comfort, speediness, safety, ticketing service, facilities, staff service, and provision of information—influenced passenger satisfaction. The results of the Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test indicated that the factors influencing passenger satisfaction significantly varied across a passenger’s gender and age. A more in-depth and comprehensive analysis using the ordered logit model and segmentation approach proved that provision of information, comfort, staff service, and facilities were critical determiners of passenger satisfaction in most segments. Safety factors and ticketing services had no impact on overall passenger satisfaction. The findings of this research could help LRT service providers, researchers, and policymakers formulate effective strategies for enhancing passenger satisfaction and increase the ridership for LRT services.},

 abstract = {Light rail transit (LRT) systems are vital aspects of the worldwide endeavor to achieve transport sustainability and have been essential in enhancing the economies of urban areas. Issues such as pollution, the risk of road accidents, and traffic congestion could be resolved using this progressive alternative. The statistics showed that only 20% of the commuters in Malaysia use public transport, including LRT, and 80% use private transportation. It is relatively low compared to other Asian countries. High-quality service is essential to improve users’ perceived satisfaction with the provided services and increase LRT ridership. The objective of the present study is to acquire an understanding of which factors are crucially influential on users’ perceptions of satisfaction. In-person questionnaires were utilized to obtain the information for this paper, with a total of 417 LRT riders in Malaysia’s Klang Valley surveyed. This study adopted the factor analysis, correlation test, and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Eight elements related to the quality of service were extracted to ascertain how they influenced the perceived satisfaction of users: information signs, ticket-based services, amenities, safety, employee performance, speed, comfort, and the service details available to riders. Each factor was significantly related to the perceptions of satisfaction, according to the correlation test. Finally, the ANN model shows that the dominant factors determining the LRT users’ perceived satisfaction are the signage, amenities, and provision of information. The findings of this research should benefit the providers of services, policy makers, and planning departments by enabling them to formulate successful approaches that ensure user satisfaction is enhanced and the number of riders on the LRT increases.},

@article{iseki2010sty,
 abstract = {A typical door-to-door trip on public transit entails walking from one’s origin to a bus stop or train station, waiting for one’s vehicle to arrive, boarding the vehicle, traveling in the vehicle, alighting from the vehicle, perhaps transferring to another vehicle, and then walking to one’s final destination. Transit travelers expend a great deal of time and energy on out-of-vehicle walking and waiting, which plays greatly into their perceived burden of transit travel. Despite the importance of out-of-vehicle transit travel, the in-vehicle travel experience has tended to garner the lion’s share of attention from transit managers and researchers. Accordingly, this study is concerned with the out-of-vehicle segments of transit travel and with ways to reduce the perceived burdens of walking, waiting, and transferring to improve users’ experience at transit stops and stations. Using a wait/walk/transfer impedance framework developed in an earlier phase of this research, we designed and administered a survey to 749 transit users at 12 transit stops and stations around metropolitan Los Angeles. The paper's analysis of the survey data finds that the most important determinant of user satisfaction with a transit stop or station has no direct connection to the physical characteristics of the facility – instead, frequent, reliable service in an environment of personal safety that matters most to riders. In other words, most transit users would prefer short, predictable waits for buses and trains in a safe, if simple or even dreary, environment over long waits for late-running vehicles in even the most elaborate and attractive transit station, especially if they fear for their safety. While perhaps surprising to those focused on the influence of urban design on travel behavior, these findings should be heartening to transit managers focused on delivering quality transit service to users. Though comfortable, informative and attractive stops and stations can indeed make traveling by public transit more agreeable, what passengers want most is safe, frequent, and reliable service.},

However, due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic in 2020, the civil aviation industry of various countries in the world has encountered severe challenges. Predicting aircraft passenger satisfaction and excavating the main influencing factors can help airlines improve their services and gain advantages in difficult situations and competition. This paper proposes a RF-RFE-Logistic feature selection model to extract the influencing factors of passenger satisfaction. First, preliminary feature selection is performed using recursive feature elimination based on random forest (RF-RFE). Second, based on different classification models, KNN, logistic regression, random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and BP neural network, the classification performance of the models before and after feature selection is compared, and the prediction model with the best classification performance is selected. Finally, based on the RF-RFE feature selection, combined with the logistic model, the factors affecting customer satisfaction are further extracted. The experimental results show that the RF-RFE model selects a feature subset containing 17 variables. In the classification prediction model, the random forest after RF-RFE feature selection shows the best classification performance. Finally, combined with the four important variables extracted by RF-RFE and logistic regression, further discussion is carried out, and suggestions are given for airlines to improve passenger satisfaction.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparison of customer loyalty levels between conventional travel agents and travel agents that use digital strategies in their business processes. This study uses a descriptive and quantitative approach. Data collection methods use surveys and snowball sampling techniques. The results of the study indicate that there is a significant difference in the level of customer loyalty between conventional and online travel agents. Conventional travel agent consumers tend to be more loyal because they receive direct interaction with travel agency managers, customers also get direct service from staff, this direct service and interaction have been shown to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. Online travel agent consumers are more price sensitive and have lower loyalty levels, even though they choose to use digital services considering effectiveness and efficiency factors. The conclusion of the study is that conventional travel agency consumers prefer personalized services and direct interaction with service providers, while online travel agency consumers prioritize price and have considerations for access to reviews in determining travel agents. Researchers suggest that management design an effective strategy to combine conventional and digital activities in the business process and services provided to customers, conventional travel agents must continue to emphasize direct interactions that have been well established and excellent, while online agents must improve customization elements and customer service to increase loyalty.},

 abstract = {Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is a crucial component in urban traffic management, aiming to optimize road network efficiency and reduce congestion. Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs. Our project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/LLMTSCS.},

From this, Thailand moved into the 10th spot with 35.4 million visitors, and US$57.5 billion in tourism earnings, which represented 12% of Thailand’s GDP. Therefore, given the critical nature of tourism to Thailand’s economy and the national carrier’s role, the authors sought to investigate how customer relationship management (CRM), perceived risk (PR), perceived service quality, and passenger trust (PT) affected Thai Airways’ passenger satisfaction (PS). The research tool developed for the survey consisted of a questionnaire which used a seven-level, Likert type agreement scale for 34 items in Part 2. The study also conducted both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the sample of 565 Thai Airways’ passengers. A latent variable path analysis was performed using LISREL 9.1 software, with the models found to be consistent with empirical data. The causal factors in the model had both a positive and negative influence on Thai Airways passenger satisfaction (PS), which can be explained by 14% of the variance (R2). The four variables ranked in importance included customer relationship management (CRM), perceived risk (PR), passenger trust (PT), and perceived service quality (PSQ), which had a total value of 1.00, -0.35, 0.20 and 0.11, respectively.

Introduction Due to fast-paced economic growth within the Asian ‘tiger economies’, there has been a knock-on effect and surge in air travel demand. Despite unfavorable external shocks such as natural disasters, war, and terrorism (Hogan, 2017), economic turbulence, and fuel price increases, the global air travel industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate [CAGR] over 10 years of 5.5%. In 2017 alone, global revenue per passenger kilometer rose 7.6% over 2016, and international passenger traffic increased 7.9%, capacity rose 6.4%, and load factors climbed to 80.6%. Additionally, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization [UNWTO], global international tourist arrivals rose to a record of 1.32 billion. From this, Thailand moved into the 10th spot, with 35.4 million visitors, and US$57.5 billion in tourism earnings. This represents 12% of Thailand’s GDP (ASEAN Today, 2018). Data from the Asia-Pacific region also shows Asian carriers even did better, which posted annual demand growth of 9.4% over 2016. This was driven by robust regional economic expansion, and an increase in route options for travelers (IATA, 2017). Asia-Pacific led all the regions in annual growth rate, with capacity rising 7.9%, and load factors climbing to 79.6%. Contributing factors to these stellar numbers has been the rising per-capita income within the region, affordability of air travel, the rise of low-cost carriers (LCCs), open sky agreements, reduction in global fuel prices, and easing of visa restrictions (ASEAN Today, 2018; Charoensuthipan, 2018; Dupont, 2014; Vuthisopon and Srinuan, 2017). By 2036, Asia will be the world’s largest aviation market as it Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 13 Issue 3 April 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 161 continues at a growth rate of CAGR of 5.7% (IATA, 2017). Also, according to America’s aircraft manufacturer Boeing, to meet booming demand, 43,000 new aircraft will be needed over the next two decades (Boeing upgrades aircraft forecast, 2018). European arch-rival Airbus has also forecast similar numbers, and has suggested that within the next two decades, the world's passenger fleet would more than double to 48,000 aircraft. Airbus has put the global value of nearly 37,400 new aircraft at US$5.8 trillion by 2037. Within Asia, Thailand has grown to be a popular international tourist destination as well. Located in Southeast Asia, Thailand’s Airports of Thailand (AOT) has reported that in 2017 the Kingdom transited 129.2 million passengers (The International Trade Administration, 2018). Furthermore, there were 823,575 aircraft takeoffs and landings in 2017, an increase from 790,194 in 2016, with air cargo also showing a significant increase, rising to 1.60 million tons in 2017 from 1.45 million tons in 2016. Commercial aviation, therefore, plays a critical role in a nation's economy, with international aviation closely related to the expansion of tourism, of which 55% is done by air (UNWTO, 2018, p.4). Aviation’s importance to the world’s economy can be found in the 2016 international tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) statistics, which reached 1.235 billion individuals and US$1.2 trillion in the same year. Also, according to the UNWTO (2018), international tourism generated an additional US$216 billion in exports through international air passenger transport services, bringing the total value of tourism exports to US$1.4 trillion, or US$4 billion a day on average. This represents 7% of the world’s exports of goods and services and 30% of services exports alone. Although numerous full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCC) fly to Thailand, the national carrier for Thailand is Thai Airways, which was created by the Thai government in March 1960. Sometime later, on July 19, 1991, the national carrier became listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which today is serving over 80 destinations worldwide (Thai Airways Annual Report, 2017). However, even despite past and projected growth, Thai Airways has faced various and significant problems in recent years. According to the Thai Airways Annual Report (2017), this has included a decrease in competitiveness, unprofitable routes outnumbering profitable ones, a wide range of aircraft types resulting in higher maintenance cost, inefficient overall cost management, and inappropriate human resource management (HRM) and development. Moreover, intense and fast-changing competitive conditions within the airline business has caused the airline continued losses, contributing to an inability to recover. Furthermore, low-cost carrier (LCC) competition has been tough year after year, with FSC national carriers such as Thai Airways, Malaysian Airways, and now even Singapore Airways, finding profitability and market share ever more challenging to obtain (Srisook and Panjakajornsak, 2017). An example of this dilemma, Thai Airways which after a net loss of $445 million in 2014, had their debt skyrocket to US$5.9 billion, the highest among Southeast Asian airlines (DuPont, 2017). However, Thai Airways is not alone, as Duport (2015) has reported that there are less than five profitable LCCs in the region (for 24 airlines), and barely ten FSCs out of around 40. In 2017 global airlines also carried an estimated 1.2 billion passengers, with Southeast Asian passenger traffic growing by approximately 10%. Southeast Asian airlines now have 1,600 airplanes on order (Tani, 2018), in addition to an active fleet of close to 2,000 airplanes, with LCCs currently accounting for approximately 70% of Thailand's domestic seat capacity. Also, in Thailand over the past five years, the domestic market has grown dramatically due to economic growth and an expanding middle class. This has led to rapid LCC expansion from approximately 11 million passenger seats in 2012, to 33 million in 2017 (Centre for Aviation, 2018). As we can see, Thai Airways has significant challenges to overcome, both internally and externally. However, given the importance of Thai Airways being the national carrier, the authors undertook a study to investigate how the variables customer relationship management (CRM), perceived service quality (PSQ), perceived risk (PR), and passenger trust (PT), affected Thai Airways passenger satisfaction (PS). It is hoped that from this research, a more sustainable and competitive solution will be found in boosting and retaining the airline’s passenger satisfaction.

Customer relationship management (CRM) In a fiercely competitive and economically demanding environment, airlines today are struggling to gain market share and sustain profitability. To do this, the airlines must develop new ways to manage their customer relationships to optimize customer loyalty and revenues, with mobile devices and ubiquitous Internet access having led to a dramatic evolution in the travel customer’s experience, allowing for greater personalization and the expectation of real-time, up-to-date information about every aspect of their trip (TIBCO, 2017). Often a profit center for airlines, CRM platforms are often viewed as nothing more than a frequent flyer program (FFP), with FFPs having been proven to be highly effective, with high cash generation ability (Agrawal, 2013). However, FFPs are now shifting the focus from customer satisfaction to revenue optimization within the airline industry, and the turning of FFPs and their CRM process into profit centers (Agrawal, 2013). A close look at many airlines also shows that although they have created vast amounts of passenger data obtained from their interactions with their passengers, the airlines are far behind in applying 'big data' in designing comprehensive CRM programs and strategies. Often times, they lose control of their data as airlines ‘outsource’ their CRM process to global distribution systems (GDSs) and online travel agencies (OTAs), which have driven a wedge between airlines and their customers (TIBCO, 2017). However, CRM should be viewed as a competitive strategy that addresses the needs of consumers and integrates },

 abstract = {This paper aims to explore the factors influencing passengers’ satisfaction toward bus transit and develop the improvement strategy for the small-medium city. Data including individual attributes, travel activity attributes, and perceived service attributes were collected in the city of Weinan, China. The ordered logit (OL) model and ordered Probit (OP) model were employed to explore the significant factors associated with passengers’ satisfaction toward bus transit. The odds ratio (OR) was applied to quantitatively measure the effects of the significant factors. Improving strategies of bus transit service were proposed based on the model results using the three-factor theory. Results show that the OL model outperforms the OP model. The age, daily average waiting time, perceived waiting time, transferring convenience, the attitude of the driver, intelligent travel information service, hygienic environment inside the bus, ticket price, bus route setting, and bus stop setting significantly affect the passengers’ satisfaction. Among them, the ticket price, perceived waiting time, bus stop setting, intelligent travel information service, transferring convenience, and bus route setting were identified as exciting factors. It is recommended that optimization of bus route and bus stop setting, building bus dedicated lanes, optimizing dynamic charging system, and providing intelligent travel information service could be effective strategies to improve passengers’ satisfaction toward bus transit in Chinese small-medium cities.},

 abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a more important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC networks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and sensing (C\&S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas simultaneously provide C\&S services for multiple ground communication users (CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\&S, we formulate a joint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation requirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and inference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based optimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt engineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA optimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to handle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast convergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model, outperforming various benchmark schemes.},

We second integrate LLMs as black-box search operators with MOP-specifically designed prompt engineering into the framework of MOEA to solve optimization sub-problems simultaneously.

Recently, people have been excited about using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate code. Professionals in the safety-critical software field are intrigued by the code generation capabilities of LLMs. However, there is currently a lack of systematic case studies in this area. Aiming at the need for automated code generation in safety-critical domains such as nuclear energy and the automotive industry, this paper conducts a case study on generating safety-critical software code using GPT-4 as the tool. Practical engineering cases from the industrial domain are employed. We explore different approaches, including code generation based on overall requirements, specific requirements, and augmented prompts. We propose a novel prompt engineering method called Prompt-FDC that integrates basic functional requirements, domain feature generalization, and domain constraints. This method improves code completeness from achieving 30% functions to 100% functions, increases the code comment rate to 26.3%, and yields better results in terms of code compliance, readability, and maintainability. The code generation approach based on LLMs also introduces a new software development process and V-model lifecycle for safety-critical software. Through systematic case studies, we demonstrate that, with appropriate prompt methods, LLMs can auto-generate safety-critical software code that meets practical engineering application requirements. It is foreseeable that LLMs can be applied to various engineering domains to improve software safety and development efficiency.},

The widespread use of social media presents an opportunity to investigate the performance of transport services from the customer’s perspective. This study proposes a framework for integrating quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate the perceptions of transport services by mining data from social media. We utilise Sina Weibo data related to the Shenzhen metro system to illustrate a text mining process categorised by semantic, spatial and temporal information. On the semantic front, in addition to identifying service attributes and sentiment polarity consistent with previous literature, we find attributes specific to the Chinese context. We also identify clear temporal variations among different service attributes by visualising the number of corresponding microblogs across varying time scales such as hours, days and weekdays. The spatial variations reveal five main clusters around central business districts and transport hubs, which produce the highest density of reports about crowdedness, waiting times, reliability and frequency. However, microblogs that report on perceptions of safety and personnel behaviour present a different spatial pattern. This research offers insights into the ways in which we can use social media data to identify key service areas for immediate improvement and to monitor and manage metro systems more effectively over the long term.},

The microblogs reveal a distinct gender gap in terms of quantity, as nearly 74% are posted by women. While women tend to be more concerned about the comfort of transit environment (e.g., temperature, crowdedness, and safety, especially at night), men tend to be more interested in transit systems' e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. Overall, this study presents a methodological framework and empirical case study about how we can utilize certain social media mining techniques to investigate gendered, subjective travel experiences, providing researchers and practitioners with an innovative way to gather customer service feedback and build more inclusive service systems.},

 abstract = {In a rapidly evolving and highly competitive transportation market, increasing customer satisfaction and ridership retention are essential for transit agencies. Understanding how different market segments perceive transit services can help service providers to identify potential priority areas and develop specialised strategies to address their varying travel concerns. However, traditional studies have predominantly investigated the varia - tions across socioeconomic cohorts or travel characteristics but ignored the complex effect of spatial, temporal, and user heterogeneity. Recently social media data has attracted growing interest from academia as an alter - native way to compensate public attitude surveys with a high volume of semantic, spatial, and temporal in - formation. This study collected 177,807 microblogs from Sina Weibo to understand how customer satisfaction varies among different market segments characterised by social, temporal, and spatial heterogeneity. Method - ologically, this study applies sentiment analysis as a real-time measurement of customers ’ satisfaction towards transit services, covering safety, crowdedness, reliability, personnel behaviour, and comfort. A beta regression model is then applied to identify the most important explanatory factors and the extent to which explanatory factors affect customers ’ satisfaction, respectively. The result indicates that age, gender, travel mode, time, and space significantly contribute to customers ’ satisfaction with the transit system. Their varying impacts on different service attributes are also identified in this study. This study also reveals the highly polarised nature of online sentiment, explaining gendered attitudes. Our research framework could be used as a benchmark for other service industries to conduct similar market segment analysis and integrate it into the policy decision process.},

The original contributions of this paper are: the definition of customer typologies based on advanced customer segmentation with latent class clustering; analysis of the effect of SQ perceptions on behavioural intentions within the behavioural theory framework that considers multiple attitudes simultaneously affecting customers’ intentions; identification of transit service improvement opportunities for specific customer typologies as well as common to most customers. Our research shows practitioners and researchers that specific needs and perceptions of customers can be identified by using advanced segmentation. We applied our method to a light-rail transit service in Seville, Spain. We measured the direct effects on behavioural intentions of the LRT SQ, customer satisfaction and, in the case of some customers, the available transportation alternatives. Other observed that attitudes of customers were indirectly related to behavioural intentions as well. We found customer agreement around these LRT SQ aspects of tangible service equipment, accessibility, information, individual space and environmental pollution. Customers clearly showed different opinions related to safety, customer service and availability.},

 abstract = {User satisfaction is an important aspect to consider in any public transport system, and as such, regular and sound measurements of its levels are fundamental. However, typical evaluation schemes involve costly and time-consuming surveys. As a consequence, their frequency is not enough to properly and timely characterize the satisfaction of the users. In this paper, we propose a methodology, based on Twitter data, to capture the satisfaction of a large mass of users of public transport, allowing us to improve the characterization and location of their satisfaction level. We analyzed a massive volume of tweets referring to the public transport system in Santiago, Chile (Transantiago) using text mining techniques, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling, in order to capture and group bus users’ expressions. Results show that, although the level of detail and variety of answers obtained from surveys are higher than the ones obtained by our method, the amount of bus stops and bus services covered by the proposed scheme is larger. Moreover, the proposed methodology can be effectively used to diagnose problems in a timely manner, as it is able to identify and locate trends, and issues related to bus operating firms, whereas surveys tend to produce average answers. Based on the consistency and logic of the results, we argue that the proposed methodology can be used as a valuable complement to surveys, as both present different, but compatible characteristics.},

 abstract = {Travel behavior prediction is a fundamental task in transportation demand management. The conventional methods for travel behavior prediction rely on numerical data to construct mathematical models and calibrate model parameters to represent human preferences. Recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) has shown great reasoning abilities to solve complex problems. In this study, we propose to use LLMs to predict travel behavior with prompt engineering without data-based parameter learning. Specifically, we carefully design our prompts that include 1) task description, 2) travel characteristics, 3) individual attributes, and 4) guides of thinking with domain knowledge, and ask the LLMs to predict an individual's travel behavior and explain the results. We select the travel mode choice task as a case study. Results show that, though no training samples are provided, LLM-based predictions have competitive accuracy and F1-score as canonical supervised learning methods such as multinomial logit, random forest, and neural networks. LLMs can also output reasons that support their prediction. However, though in most of the cases, the output explanations are reasonable, we still observe cases that violate logic or with hallucinations.},

Using the Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AALRT) as a case, this study aims to examine service users' views and perspectives by using 18 quality attributes. Factor analysis and ordered logit model were employed for this study. Factor analysis with principal components was used to extract the most important factors of satisfaction from the 18 attributes. The results showed that safety and security, ticketing system, travel information, crowdedness, frequency, cleanliness, and comfort are the most important factors influencing user satisfaction. The level of importance of these factors varies depending on different socioeconomic and travel characteristics of AALRT users. Riders who use the light rail at afternoon peak hours, have high household income and short travel duration, and use LRT for shopping purposes have a negative perception regarding the crowdedness, frequency, ticketing, and information system of the AALRT. Passengers with longer travel distance, those who use the AALRT frequently, and full- or part-time workers and students have a positive perception towards several attributes of the system.},

In total, 6340 valid questionnaires were completed, and basic data about the passengers were statistically analyzed. Based on AHP and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, 94.594 percent of passengers reported overall satisfaction with the Qingdao rail transit; the data for subgroups based on gender, age, and other aspects were also calculated. An independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used to analyze the correlations between passenger satisfaction and the following parameters: gender, age, education, occupation, income, ride frequency, and private car availability. The results show that women attach more importance to the caring they feel in the process of travel than men, and no significant difference exists in travel satisfaction between passengers with private cars and those without private cars (p > 0.05). Older passengers report more satisfaction than younger passengers. Additionally, for passengers with high education and high income, satisfaction is lower in terms of safety, convenience, and comfort and caring. There are also significant differences in the safety, convenience, comfort, and caring experienced across different occupational groups. These research results provide a theoretical basis for understanding how passengers with different backgrounds perceive the operational services of an urban rail transit with regard to service defects, the weaknesses in the operation process, and passenger satisfaction.},

However, their implementation has a dual character: on one hand, AI facilitates sustainable solutions, including energy optimization, renewable energy integration and carbon reduction; on the other hand, the training and operation of large language models (LLMs) entail significant energy consumption, potentially undermining carbon neutrality efforts. Key findings include an analysis of 237 scientific publications from 2010 to 2024, which highlights significant advancements and obstacles to AI adoption across sectors, such as construction, transportation, industry, energy and households. The review showed that interest in the use of AI and ML in energy efficiency has grown significantly: over 60% of the documents have been published in the last two years, with the topics of sustainable construction and climate change forecasting attracting the most interest. Most of the articles are published by researchers from China, India, the UK and the USA, (28–33 articles). This is more than twice the number of publications from researchers around the rest of the world; 58% of research is concentrated in three areas: engineering, computer science and energy. In conclusion, the review also identifies areas for further research aimed at minimizing the negative impacts of AI and maximizing its contribution to sustainable development, including the development of more energy-efficient AI architectures and new methods of energy management.},

In public transportation, it has been adopted to assess the attributes of transit system. To analyze the practical implementation of IPA in transit user satisfaction studies, an extensive literature review was carried out to identify challenges. Unlike the “performance” dimension, measuring “importance” is challenging, given the wide variety of approaches and specific methods. For practical application, choosing a specific method in a specific approach has diverse implications. Real-world transit user satisfaction surveys of three different bus transit (sub) systems in Bogotá were used to try, test, and compare results, methods, applications, and—from a practical perspective—to identify the pitfalls, risks, difficulties, advantages, and biases of using different techniques to measure importance in relation to public transportation services. At the end of the paper, the advantages and shortcomings of different importance measurement methods are synthesized, and easy-to-implement suggestions for practitioners are provided.},

In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer the mentioned travel modes from social media posts, and reason people's attitudes toward the associated travel mode, without the need for manual annotation. We compare different LLMs along with various prompting engineering methods in light of human assessment and LLM verification. We find that most social media posts manifest negative rather than positive sentiments. We thus identify the contributing factors to these negative posts and, accordingly, propose recommendations to traffic operators and policymakers.},

 abstract = {There are numerous works on availability studies, among others. In [3] a general overview of main strategies and technical steps which should be taken when designing an optimum public transportation system. Operational availability as a characteristic of transportation systems is used for analysis of so-called fast reaction systems in random moments of operations (t), for example air force, emergency medical services, fire brigades or public transportation systems [5]. Analysis of availability of different systems has been researched into by many studies in recent years. Nowadays it is applied in many sectors of the industry, including aircraft and defense sectors as well as power engineering and transportation. In [5] the authors present the possibilities of application of the RAM (Reliability, Availability and Maintainability) model in industry to identify unreliable devices with respect to operation-related frequent failures or requirements. In [23] the authors investigate the dependencies between availability and maintainability of transportation modes and the costs of unplanned breaks and vehicle operation. The authors developed an economically-optimum model of implementation for inspection and technical services that was based on current data on vehicle damage. The study [19] examined several scenarios regarding the reliability of buses and repair service employees’ shift system in a transport company to increase the vehicle’s availability and reduce costs of the whole system regarding its disturbance at vehicle failure. In [18] and [28] the authors present an optimization model of public transportation considering the design of transit routes, selection of modes of transportation and timetables. The study [24] presents a method of designing the availability of technological objects, and in [10] a theory pertaining to semi-Markov processes was used based on the authentic municipal transport system. In [2] the authors identified the object’s aptitude condition, and thus optimal control processes of operation and service of particular objects on the example of public transportation bus engines. In [27] the authors present different methods applied to estimate a functional form between overall quality of service and explanatory variables, including questionnaire items related to satisfaction accessibility (availability, information, time characteristics of service, customer service, comfort, safety, infrastructure and environment). The operational availability index was mainly used for bus schedule reliability and current monitoring of transportation systems, especially vehicle punctuality [3, 4, 26] however, it was not often used to control quality management systems and maintenance of a given make of a vehicle. The municipal transport company should assure a continuous monitoring on maintenance process in terms of current availability of used fleet. Resting on this assumption, the authors of the paper conducted studies on operational availability of buses of the selected makes from Joanna RymARz Andrzej NiewczAs Aneta KRzyżAK},

 abstract = {India's burgeoning population has led to an increased demand for transportation services, particularly in urban areas. To address the growing mobility needs and mitigate the adverse effects of personal vehicle usage, efficient public transit services are imperative. Several Indian cities have implemented bus rapid transit (BRT) systems to address this problem, but ridership for the majority of the BRT systems remains below breakeven (this refers to the point at which the revenue generated from ridership equals or surpasses the costs associated with operating and maintaining the transportation system). Thus, it is necessary to assess the determinants of commuter satisfaction with BRT. The present study aims to examine factors affecting travel satisfaction among BRT commuters. By using structural equation modeling (SEM), the effect of demographic (age and gender) and travel-related variables (fare price, travel time, trip frequency, reliability, ease of using bus service, and comfort level) on BRT commuters' satisfaction and usage of BRT services were analyzed. It was found that while ease of using the service, comfort level, and reliability positively affect BRT travel satisfaction, trip frequency is significantly affected by the ease of using the service only. Furthermore, demographic variables (age, and gender of respondents) were not found to have significant effect of travel satisfaction and trip frequency. The findings from this can study serve as a base for policymakers, city officials, and urban planners to identify commuters' priorities for a well-functioning BRT in India and formulate policies to attract riders by enhancing their preferences.},

Contract management is a critical process for energy companies operating across upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors. These companies deal with numerous complex contracts containing intricate legal language, cross-references, and long document lineages spanning amendments and supplemental materials. Manually extracting insights and managing obligations from these highly unstructured contracts is extremely time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging machine learning and generative AI (GenAI) to automate and streamline contract management. The proposed solution utilizes large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and chain-of-thought reasoning to extract structured data (such as fees, escalations etc.) from contracts, perform analyses, and generate natural language responses. It enables use cases like optionality analysis, fee calculation, cross-contract insight generation, invoice processing, and user feedback integration. The architecture combines LLMs with contract knowledge bases and external data sources to optimize operations, mitigate risks, and enhance decision-making. Key capabilities include centralized repositories, clause extraction, compliance tracking, workflow automation, and advanced analytics leveraging LLM question-answering, summarization, and code generation abilities. The paper discusses technical details, use case scenarios applicable to crude oil transportation contracts in supply & chain, and highlights GenAI's potential to transform energy industry contract management practices. When conducting analyses involving hundreds of contracts, the proposed solution exhibited significant efficiency gains. Case studies showed that it reduced processing time by 10 to 100 times compared to manual methods.},

@article{susilo2014exp,
 abstract = {Using a primary dataset from an experimental survey in eight European cities, this study identified the key determinants of satisfaction with individual trip stages as well as overall journey experience for different travel modes and traveler groups. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to examine the relationships between overall satisfaction and travel experience variables, trip complexity, subjective well-being indices, travel-related attitudes as well as individual- and trip-specific attributes. The results indicate that for certain traveler groups, such as women, young and low-income or unemployed travelers, there are distinctive determinants of satisfaction with trip stages for various travel modes. The results also indicate that satisfaction with the primary trip stage is strongly linked to overall trip satisfaction, while satisfaction levels with access and egress trip stages are strongly related to satisfaction with the primary trip stage. Past experience, traveler expectations and attitudes, and the emotional state of travelers are also significant explanatory variables for travel satisfaction. The results indicate that when an individual consciously chooses a particular travel mode, they will report a higher level of satisfaction with that chosen mode. Notwithstanding, while past experience highly influences an individual’s current travel satisfaction, the more they travel with the current mode, the less satisfied they are with their choice. The results of this study highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the interaction between instrumental variables and non-instrumental variables at different trip stages and the influence on user preferences, satisfaction and decision-making processes.},

Purpose
This study analyses the factors that can influence the quality of service provided by the bus rapid transit (BRT) system in the state of Pernambuco. It is incipient, considering that the system was implemented in this state in 2014 to the World cup. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to identify the factors considered important for the services provided by this system and their impact on perceived quality.


Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyzed the data using exploratory factorial analysis, and linear and quantile regression techniques. Regarding the classification, this research is applied, exploratory, descriptive and in the form of a case study describing the situation experienced by the users of BRT in Pernambuco.


Findings
The results showed that it was possible to identify five factors that impact the level of satisfaction of the offered services: fluency in the provision of the service; staff training; physical conditions in the provision of the service; convenience/accessibility; and integration between transport lines.


Originality/value
With initial identification, factors 1, 3, 4 and 5 have been found to have an impact on overall service quality in a positive and statistically significant way. Factors 3 and 4 have a different impact with high- and low-quality standard perceived by users, and these should be the guiding elements by companies in establishing actions to improve the services offered.},

Although OTA is a future tourism trend, there is still much room for improvement in terms of its brand and customer service. Therefore, this study investigates the relationships among customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and consumer repurchase intentions from the perspective of service quality, and form a conceptual model for constructing consumer repurchase intentions. This study conducted a structural equation model (SEM) analysis of 226 samples. Based on the analysis results, there were two findings: First, for the influencing factors of consumer repurchase intentions, the positive direct impact of service quality is higher than brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. Second, in the proposed model, brand loyalty and customer satisfaction play the mediation variable between service quality and repurchase intention. The service quality will not only directly affect the repurchase intention, but also has an indirect impact through brand loyalty and customer satisfaction.},

The aim is to uncover factors that drive their modal choices and to assess the quality implications of the variability of the users' perceived satisfaction through the use of two statistical methods ordered logit and linear mixed models and comprehensive diagrammatic techniques. Five transit systems in the two major cities in Greece, Athens and Thessaloniki, have been examined. The analysis demonstrated that the most important satisfaction attributes are service frequency, followed by waiting conditions and network coverage, punctuality and in-vehicle transport conditions. A gender-based market segmentation analysis provided further insight into the differences among groups of the population. According to this analysis, female respondents tend to place their attention on punctuality, waiting conditions and driver behavior, while male respondents on in-vehicle transport conditions and the existence and quality of transfer information.},

 abstract = {The deployment of public charging infrastructure networks has been a major factor in enabling electric vehicle (EV) technology transition and must continue to support the adoption of this technology. DC fast charging (DCFC) increases customer convenience by lowering charging time, enables long-distance EV travel, and could allow the electrification of high-mileage fleets. Yet, high capital costs and uneven power demand have been major challenges to the widespread deployment of DCFC stations. There is a need to better understand DCFC stations’ loading and customer service quality. Furthermore, the relationship between the initial investment decision on building certain number of ports and customer satisfaction should be quantified. This paper aims to analyze these aspects using one million vehicle days of travel data within the Columbus, OH, USA, region. Monte Carlo analysis is carried out in three types of areas—urban, suburban, and rural—to quantify the effect of uncertain parameters on DCFC station loading and service quality. Additional simulations based on a homogeneous vehicle population are carried out, and closed-form equations are derived therefrom to estimate charging duration and waiting time in the queue. Optimization of DCFC station design is also addressed through the number and capacity of ports.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the behavioral drivers underlying the adoption of a multimodal travel information mobile app. The hypothesized framework is validated empirically through the case-study of Madrid. Madrid’s Public Transport real-time information app (“Mi Transporte”) allows users to obtain customized and automated information. A three-wave survey containing questions aligned with the Theory of Planned Behavior was conducted in 2015 and 2016 with a representative sample of transit users. Data analysis includes a factor analysis and a structural equation model to validate the hypotheses. The model assumes that the intention to use the app can be explained as a function of attitudinal factors and respondent characteristics. Results show that the app adoption is correlated with the intention of the users to adopt it and with their willingness-to-pay; the users’ intentions can be explained by various factors like user’s expectations on the app, affinity for technology (technophilia) and the previous use of other transport apps. The roles of search functionalities, side-mode information, time saving skills and the importance of the Level of Service (LOS) are also analyzed in the model. Relations between user characteristics and latent variables are subsequently explained as well as the ex-post satisfaction and change in travel patterns to measure the impact on the transport behavior of the app users. The study provides a better understanding of app adoption based on traveler characteristics, the attributes of the app and the perception of its capabilities.},

 abstract = {The availability of wireless networks and the pervasive use of mobile ICT devices have allowed passengers to conduct various e-activities during journeys. These various e-activities, in turn, may change people ’ s conventional perception of travel time from being “ wasteful ” and “ unproductive, ” to “ desirable ” and giving rise to satisfaction. Journeys on high-speed railway (HSR) is particularly relevant for transport researchers to probe into this question because of its characteristics of being medium to long-distance (typically taking half-an-hour or more), seat availability, and a smooth ride. Using a questionnaire survey on passengers along the Shanghai-Nanjing HSR route, this study aims to examine the nature of ICT device use and in-vehicle e-activities conducted by HSR passengers and the in fl uence on their travel satisfaction with their on-board journey experience. Our results reveal a high percentage of ICT device use and a wide variety of e-activities such as e-working, e-communication, and e-reading for leisure on HSR trains. In addition, the higher use of ICT device was associated with an increase of passengers ’ travel satisfaction. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of work-related e-activities on travel satisfaction for business/work trips, while a positive effect of entertainment-related e-activities for non-business/work trips. Given that HSR is potentially a more sustainable transport mode, some possible policy implications are proposed to encourage people to use HSR, as opposed to driving or fl ying, for medium to long-distance intercity journeys.},

Accurately identifying the core factors that influence user experience (UX) not only enhances service quality and optimizes user satisfaction, but also promotes the dissemination of green travel concepts. However, the influencing factors and their mechanisms vary significantly across regions, particularly along the Chengdu–Lhasa (G318) route, which features large elevation changes, diverse climatic conditions, rugged terrain, and frequent geological disasters, making the influencing factors particularly complex. This study analyzes comment texts from 38 shared charging stations along the G318 route in the e-Charging APP, totaling 15,214 comments. A comprehensive approach is employed, including high-frequency word analysis, term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) comparison, co-occurrence semantic network and co-word matrix feature correlation analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. This multifaceted analysis explores core themes, user viewpoints, and sentiments in the comments, focusing on users’ perspectives on service quality, usage experience, and environmental impact of the charging stations. The findings indicate that charging speed, service attitude, environment, operational status of hardware and software, and pricing are key factors influencing user sentiment. Users have a high demand for the perfection of supporting facilities of shared charging stations, directly affecting user satisfaction and indirectly influencing the brand image and market competitiveness of enterprises.},

This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence.

The study also investigates the mediating role of perceived value on the relationship between service quality and satisfaction, as well as the moderating role of hotel star ratings on all direct and indirect relationships.,Data for this study were collected via Web scraping from August–October 2018. Data were collected from 192 three- to five star-rated hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Partial least squares – structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Furthermore, importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) was performed to identify the most important items of service quality and perceived value in improving customer satisfaction.,The findings of this study provide support for all direct and indirect relationships for three-star and four- and five-star hotels. Moreover, the results indicate that perceived value mediates the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction. These results support the moderating role of hotel star ratings for the relationship between service quality and perceived value. The results also show that after perceived value, three-star hotels looking to improve customer satisfaction should prioritize improving the quality of their services, sleep quality, cleanliness and rooms. Four- and five-star hotels, on the other hand, should prioritize service, cleanliness, room and sleep quality.,OTA platforms collect a wealth of data pertaining to large number of hotels; nevertheless, few studies to date have drawn on this data to examine a pre-determined conceptual framework developed based on the literature. As such, this study makes a valuable methodological contribution to the tourism and hospitality literature. In terms of theoretical contributions, this study examines the mediating role of perceived value between service quality and satisfaction using OTA data. In addition, this study assesses the moderating role of hotel star ratings for the direct and indirect effects of service quality on satisfaction.

Few studies have, however, systematically examined the underlying relationships among service attributes to assess their influence on passenger overall satisfaction. Therefore, to contribute to this rapidly-emerging literature, this paper applies Bayesian networks to quantify the influence of each service aspect on passenger overall satisfaction with regular bus service quality. This analysis involved 609 passengers who participated in a 2013 regular bus service survey in Nanjing, China. The derived Bayesian network shows the relationships among service attributes and passenger overall satisfaction graphically. In particular, service aspects such as running on schedule, acceptable waiting time, available seats, clean onboard environment, pleasant environment at stations, convenient design for transfers, and air-conditioning were the key determinants of overall satisfaction with bus service.},

 abstract = {Effective and rapid evaluation of pavement surface condition is critical for prioritizing maintenance, ensuring transportation safety, and minimizing vehicle wear and tear. While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating road damage evaluations and underscore the pivotal role of detailed prompt engineering in achieving reliable assessments.},

 abstract = {Inspired by the success of private ridesourcing companies such as Uber and Lyft, transit agencies have started to consider integrating ridesourcing services (i.e. on-demand, app-driven ride- sharing services) with public transit. Ridesourcing services may enhance the transit system in two major ways: replacing underutilized routes to improve operational efficiency, and providing last- mile connectivity to extend transit’s catchment area. While an integrated system of ridesourcing services and public transit is conceptually appealing, little is known regarding whether and how consumers might use a system like this and what key service attributes matter the most to them. This article investigates traveler responses to a proposed integrated transit system, named MTransit, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. We conducted a large-sample survey to collect both revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data and fit a RP-SP mixed logit model to examine the main determinants of commuting mode choice. The model results show that transfers and additional pickups are major deterrents for MTransit use. We further applied the model outputs to forecast the demand for MTransit under different deployment scenarios. We find that replacing low-ridership bus lines with ridesourcing services could slightly increase transit ridership while reducing operations costs. The service improvements offered by ridesourcing mainly come from reductions in wait time. Though relatively small in our study, another source of improvement is the decrease of in-vehicle travel time. Moreover, we find that when used to provide convenient last-mile connections, ridesourcing could provide a significant boost to transit. This finding verifies a popular notion among transit professionals that ride- sourcing services can serve as a complement to public transit by enhancing last-mile transit access.},

 abstract = {The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming traffic and transportation research, with significant advancements emerging between the years 2023 and 2025 -- a period marked by the inception and swift growth of adopting and adapting LLMs for various traffic and transportation applications. However, despite these significant advancements, a systematic review and synthesis of the existing studies remain lacking. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data to advance transportation research. We explore key applications, including autonomous driving, travel behavior prediction, and general transportation-related queries, alongside methodologies such as zero- or few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning. Our analysis identifies critical research gaps. From the methodological perspective, many research gaps can be addressed by integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining LLM architectures. From the application perspective, we identify numerous opportunities for LLMs to tackle a variety of traffic and transportation challenges, building upon existing research. By synthesizing these findings, this review not only clarifies the current state of LLM adoption and adaptation in traffic and transportation but also proposes future research directions, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable transportation systems.},

@article{yuan2019ass,
 abstract = {Abstract With the rapid aging population, the number of elderly passengers using bus services for daily travel will increase. Thus, it is increasingly more important for bus companies to understand the specific service requirements and expectations of elderly passengers. However, we are not aware of any dedicated studies on service requirement and travel satisfaction of the elderly. As an inclusive society is considered a key aspect of sustainable development, guaranteeing travel satisfaction is a sine qua non for sustainable transportation. Therefore, this study develops a customer satisfaction index (CSI) for the elderly. Assuming that perceived service quality affects passenger satisfaction, a structural equation model (SEM) is estimated to derive the importance of 10 dimensions of perceived service quality: reliability, time schedule, route characteristics, ticketing, driver service, convenience, safety and security, cleanliness, comfort, and information services. Furthermore, the effect of satisfaction on loyalty and filing complaints against the service company is examined. SEM is developed using data from a bus passenger survey, administered in 2017 in Harbin, China. The results show while some service dimensions such as time schedule and reliability are less important to the elderly (possibly due to their less strict time constraints) other dimensions such as service and security, convenience and driver service are in need of improvement due to the fact that they are very important for the elderly but their perceived performance from the elderly’s perspective is low.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the dynamics of passenger satisfaction and sustainable urban mobility within the context of multimodal railway hubs, focusing on travel behaviors at major stations in China. Against the backdrop of rapid urbanization and the nation’s initiatives to improve transportation efficiency, this research employs social media data analysis to assess passenger sentiment across six key transportation hubs in Eastern China. Utilizing methodological approaches such as keyword frequency analysis and semantic categorization of 39,061 Dianping reviews, supplemented by network visualizations with Gephi, this study reveals insights into factors influencing passenger satisfaction beyond travel efficiency. Signage quality, facility availability, queueing, and crowding emerge as significant determinants of passenger behavior. The study underscores the importance of strategic improvements in station design, navigational aids, and facility management, grounded in real-time data analytics and passenger feedback, to enhance overall passenger satisfaction and promote sustainable urban mobility. This research contributes to advancing understanding of passenger behavior and informs efforts aimed at improving urban transportation systems to meet the evolving needs of passengers and cities.},

 abstract = {Understanding the behavioral intentions of public transit passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic is important for transmission control interventions oriented towards public transport system travel behavior. This paper studies the relationship between passengers’ intentions to use public transport, a set of psychological variables, and the influence of transport management policies (POLs) under COVID-19. Specifically, this study presents a framework integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and customer satisfaction (CS) theory and uses partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) applied to the survey responses of 983 residents of Tianjin, China. The empirical results support the validity of this integrated model of public transit use intentions by confirming several hypothesized relationships among the psychological variables studied. Moreover, POLs under COVID-19 are shown to enhance commuters’ intentions primarily via subjective norms (SNs), perceived behavioral control (PBC), perceived service quality (PSQ), and CS. These findings reveal the psychological mechanism through which passengers adjust their public transport travel intentions during the COVID-19 period. Based on the results, some feasible suggestions are proposed to help restore confidence in public transport after the pandemic.},

 abstract = {Demand-responsive technologies are rapidly changing the transportation landscape. The City of Belleville, Ontario has recently replaced its evening and nighttime fixed route bus service with an on-demand transit (ODT) service. Preliminary reports have found a 300% increase in nighttime bus ridership since the implementation of this service, yet to fully understand the social return on the investment in on-demand services, we must also quantify whether and for whom these new services have enabled time savings and increased levels of activity participation. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether riders are satisfied with the service, and whether satisfaction levels have an impact on activity participation. As such, this study explores the determinants of activity participation of ODT users using a custom ridership survey instrument. We collect information on travel experience, satisfaction, and perceived changes in activity participation due to ODT. We then performed a factor analysis and estimated structural equation models to identify the relationships between aspects of the ODT service and activity participation. Our results show that reliability and service quality are the most important aspects of the ODT services in terms of positively influencing activity participation, and that shorter wait times, are most likely to lead to an increase in activity participation. Our findings further suggest that Belleville can eliminate barriers to nighttime activity participation by providing reliable and affordable ODT service, and that ODT can be an effective solution to provide transit services for transport-poor in low demand areas or during low demand periods of the day.},

 abstract = {Assessing passenger satisfaction is essential to enhancing loyalty and increasing ridership on high speed rail (HSR). Many studies explore passenger satisfaction with transit and conventional railway, but there are only a few that look at HSR. Although the HSR studies provide information on the relationship between service quality and passenger satisfaction, few identify the attributes that have the largest impact or improvement priorities for existing HSR. This study employs multivariate regression and importance-performance analysis to identify influential attributes and service improvement priorities for the Shanghai-Nanjing HSR. We found that the most important correlates of passenger satisfaction were staff attitudes, convenience of ticket purchase, and ease of the access trip. In general, passengers are satisfied with HSR services, especially with the attributes that are critical to overall HSR satisfaction. However, we found that improving toilet sanitation and seat comfort on the Shanghai-Nanjing HSR would increase passenger satisfaction.},

ChatGPT has demonstrated the impressive capabilities of LLM, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the emergence of the discussion and application of LLM in various research or engineering domains, it is time to envision how LLM may revolutionize the way we approach intelligent transportation systems. This paper explores the future applications of LLM in addressing key transportation problems. By leveraging LLM and a cross-modal encoder, an intelligent system can handle traffic data from various modalities and execute transportation operations through a single LLM. NLP, combined with cross-modal processing, is investigated with its potential applications in transportation. To demonstrate this potential, a smartphone-based crash report auto-generation and analysis framework is presented as a use case. Despite the potential benefits, challenges related to data privacy, data quality, and model bias must be considered. Overall, the use of LLM in intelligent transport systems holds promise for more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable transportation systems that improve the lives of people around the world.},

 abstract = {Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts— Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving.
